## Topic models (topic_models.py)
In order to run the topic model class, we need to have two folder in the main directory including 1- data and 2- models. The main csv file containing all the data points should be at the data folder. All the files associated with topic models (including dictionaries and trained model) will be automatically saved in the models folder.
