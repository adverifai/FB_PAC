{"id":"6110179032740","text":"Jan Schneider Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  Friends of Jan Schneider  \u00b7  RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS  On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.  President Johnson recognized that \u201c[t]he vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice.\u201d   For nearly 50 years, Section 5 of the VRA required jurisdictions with the worst records to obtain preclearance from the federal government before implementing voting changes. In June 2013, however, the United States Supreme Court essentially gut ... ted Section 5 in the 5-to-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder.  The Court ruled that Section 4(b), which contains the coverage formula for Section 5, is unconstitutional because it is based on data that is over 40 years old and no longer responsive to current needs.  Without Section 4(b), no jurisdiction will be subject to preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula. Almost immediately following the Shelby decision, states and localities released from federal oversight began imposing new obstacles to voting, shortening early voting periods and closing polling places.  As recently as June 2018, the Supreme Court struck another blow to voting rights in ruling 5-to-4 in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute that the practice by the State of Ohio in purging infrequent voters from registration rolls is constitutional. This decision too is likely to lead to disproportionate disenfranchisement of minority, low-income, elderly and disabled voters.   Help restore justice and the right to vote: 1.  Contact your senators to urge them to oppose confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court; 2.  Contact your senators and representatives in support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2017 (S.1419 & H.R.2978); and 3, in Florida vote for Amendment 4.  Also, join the fight to overturn the Citizens United case!

FPPC #1396734  \u00b7  Nine years ago today, the United States Senate voted to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor as the first Latina to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. And on this day 53-years ago, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law - which expanded the promise of universal suffrage by dismantling some of the systems that kept minority voters from casting a ballot. That both should fall on the same date is fitting, as Justice Sotomayor has been an avid defender of the VRA on the ...  Supreme Court - forcefully dissenting from recent decisions that have seen the slow and steady erosion of the promises made and protections put in place by the VRA.   One of the fondest memories I have of my time working for President  Barack Obama , came just after Justice Sotomayor returned to the White House having just been confirmed by the Senate. I was part of the team that worked on her confirmation - I had been tasked with helping to mobilize support for her confirmation from outside advocacy organizations. And after the successful vote to confirm her to the Court, we held a little celebration in the White House. I vividly remember Justice Sotomayor thanking me and giving me a big hug. It was such a joyful, warm and genuine moment.  Justice Sotomayor\u2019s work on the Court has made us all very proud - as the President knew it would. And she has been a forceful defender of voting rights and the Voting Rights Act.   Her steadfast defense of voting rights was prominently on display this past June, in Abbott vs. Perez - where the Court decided to uphold Texas\u2019 gerrymandered districts. This was despite the fact that a lower court had previously found that the districts had been intentionally drawn to discriminate against Latinx voters. The words of her dissenting opinion are a clarion call to action in defense of voting rights:    \u201cThe Court today goes out of its way to permit the State of Texas to use maps that the three-judge District Court unanimously found were adopted for the purpose of preserving the racial discrimination that tainted its previous maps\u2026 This disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy. It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas\u2014despite constituting a majority of the population within the State\u2014will continue to be underrepresented in the political process. Those voters must return to the polls in 2018 and 2020 with the knowledge that their ability to exercise meaningfully their right to vote has been burdened by the manipulation of district lines specifically designed to target their communities and minimize their political will. The fundamental right to vote is too precious to be disregarded in this manner.

For more on Mitchell Street click here:  https://www.penzeys.com/\u2026/mitchell-street-s\u2026/c-24/p-652/pd-s  With Aleppo Pepper the story is more complex. Where this really tasty Pepper originally comes from is a town in Syria. For a long time, because of the war there, our Aleppo Pepper has come from just across the border in Turkey. Many of those who voted for an unqualified, Russia compromised, openly racist President have so far been spared the costs of their actions. The people of Syria have not been so lucky.  Many in Syria have not been able to dodge the reality of our election, and have paid an incredible cost for Americans rejecting a well qualified woman who understood diplomacy and how to rally allies to our side in favor of a candidate that has simply given the people of Syria up to the wishes of the Russian President. When this administration inevitably crashes, simply saying we\u2019re sorry to the people of Syria won\u2019t be enough. We have a lot of work ahead of us to pay for our responsibilities.   Aleppo Pepper is truly wonderful: a little bit of heat and a whole lot of really enjoyable flavor. See our Aleppo here:  https://www.penzeys.com/online-c\u2026/aleppo-pepper/\u2026/p-878/pd-s  Get some, use it in your cooking, share its tastiness, but please make it a reminder that voting for change this November 6 is only the first step. We are Americans; we take responsibility for our actions. We must work both at home and across the globe to make this right. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s what we do.  No coupon or codes needed for the $2 price for Aleppo and Mitchell Street Seasoning, those are automatic for all.

Sp S on S so S red S  \u00b7  On August 12th, fascists and white-supremacists will rally at Lafayette Park for the anniversary of the Unite The Right Rally. Join us at 12 pm  at Freedom Plaza , to show the white-supremacists that they are outnumbered.  At the Unite the Right rally last year, these Nazi thugs occupied and overwhelmed the city of Charlottesville, Virginia. The white-supremacists killed Heather Heyer that day. She was a brave IWW militant and she will forever be remembered as a martyr to the  ... cause. They also seriously injured others, including the ISO\u2019s own Bill Burke.  Now, on the one year anniversary of the tragedy in Charlottesville, the white-supremacists are rallying in front of the White House because even though their movement shows signs of fracture, the White House is occupied by one of their own.   We believe the best way to confront fascists is directly challenge them with large numbers of people.  This means having mass marches and recent history shows that the most successful efforts in defeating the fascists have been based on nonviolent, mass action. Last year right after Charlottesville, white-supremacists gathered in Boston, thinking they had the momentum. However, thousands turned up to confront a tiny group, and the fascists cancelled their event after 30 minutes, escorted by police and humiliated. Let us do the same thing in Washington D.C.   We need to bring out as many people as possible from as many different backgrounds - Black Lives Matter activists, immigrants rights activists, women's rights activists, activists against war and imperialism - all have an interest in stopping the far right and all of them are necessary to chase them back into the holes they came out of.  Only in numbers will we be safe and win. Only in numbers, will violence and provocation will be unnecessary. Only in numbers, will we demoralize and beat the fascists, build up our own confidence and movements.   Join us in the fight against white-supremacy, meet near Freedom Plaza, bring as many people as you can. This is our city. We will win.   Solidarity trumps hate!

{"id":"6097967908804","text":"Buffy Wicks Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  Buffy Wicks for Assembly 2018. FPPC #1396734  \u00b7  Nine years ago today, the United States Senate voted to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor as the first Latina to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. And on this day 53-years ago, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law - which expanded the promise of universal suffrage by dismantling some of the systems that kept minority voters from casting a ballot. That both should fall on the same date is fitting, as Justice Sotomayor has been an avid defender of the VRA on the ...  Supreme Court - forcefully dissenting from recent decisions that have seen the slow and steady erosion of the promises made and protections put in place by the VRA.   One of the fondest memories I have of my time working for President  Barack Obama , came just after Justice Sotomayor returned to the White House having just been confirmed by the Senate. I was part of the team that worked on her confirmation - I had been tasked with helping to mobilize support for her confirmation from outside advocacy organizations. And after the successful vote to confirm her to the Court, we held a little celebration in the White House. I vividly remember Justice Sotomayor thanking me and giving me a big hug. It was such a joyful, warm and genuine moment.  Justice Sotomayor\u2019s work on the Court has made us all very proud - as the President knew it would. And she has been a forceful defender of voting rights and the Voting Rights Act.   Her steadfast defense of voting rights was prominently on display this past June, in Abbott vs. Perez - where the Court decided to uphold Texas\u2019 gerrymandered districts. This was despite the fact that a lower court had previously found that the districts had been intentionally drawn to discriminate against Latinx voters. The words of her dissenting opinion are a clarion call to action in defense of voting rights:    \u201cThe Court today goes out of its way to permit the State of Texas to use maps that the three-judge District Court unanimously found were adopted for the purpose of preserving the racial discrimination that tainted its previous maps\u2026 This disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy. It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas\u2014despite constituting a majority of the population within the State\u2014will continue to be underrepresented in the political process. Those voters must return to the polls in 2018 and 2020 with the knowledge that their ability to exercise meaningfully their right to vote has been burdened by the manipulation of district lines specifically designed to target their communities and minimize their political will. The fundamental right to vote is too precious to be disregarded in this manner.

For years our pro-kindness message was not seen as political at all. It was only with the advent of unlimited political spending that us doing what we\u2019ve always done became political. Money buys anger, and as the Republican Party embraced anger, racism, greed and all the rest, it found a target in our belief in kindness.   I truly believe that we never crossed the line into politics, that line  ... crossed us. I\u2019m not saying we haven\u2019t embraced this new role. We are a business by Cooks for Cooks. Cooking works because it gives us the strength to care about others, the strength to be human. Now does not seem the time to back down from all this. So, \u201c2018 Kindness Campaign Victory Headquarters\u201d for us.  What does being the Kindness Campaign Headquarters mean? Well, we are kind of finding our way on this, but already I have much hope for where we will end up. At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when we take the time to care about others a better future is set in motion. In our experience we\u2019ve found that what works around the dinner table works around the world as well. When you care about humans they go on to do amazing things.  The plan is to start slow and learn along the way. Mostly for the next couple weeks that start will be right here in our home state of Wisconsin where the primary election will be held August 14. Our hope is to take what we learn here in the primaries and roll that out in our stores across the country in a get out the vote effort come this October leading into the November 6 national election. And of course 2018 is just the lead-in to 2020 and beyond. We hope to be at this for a long time.

Where this really tasty Pepper originally comes from is a town in Syria. For a long time, because of the war there, our Aleppo Pepper has come from just across the border in Turkey. Many of those who voted for an unqualified, Russia compromised, openly racist President have so far been spared the costs of their actions. The people of Syria have not been so lucky.  Many in Syria have not been able to dodge the reality of our election, and have paid an incredible cost for Americans rejecting a well qualified woman who understood diplomacy and how to rally allies to our side in favor of a candidate that has simply given the people of Syria up to the wishes of the Russian President. When this administration inevitably crashes, simply saying we\u2019re sorry to the people of Syria won\u2019t be enough. We have a lot of work ahead of us to pay for our responsibilities.   Aleppo Pepper is truly wonderful: a little bit of heat and a whole lot of really enjoyable flavor. See our Aleppo here:  https://www.penzeys.com/online-c\u2026/aleppo-pepper/\u2026/p-878/pd-s  Get some, use it in your cooking, share its tastiness, but please make it a reminder that voting for change this November 6 is only the first step. We are Americans; we take responsibility for our actions. We must work both at home and across the globe to make this right. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s what we do.  No coupon or codes needed for the $2 price for Aleppo and Mitchell Street Seasoning, those are automatic for all.  Thanks for having the kindness to cook,  Bill Penzey  bill@penzeys.com  And since we believe cooking is all about taking care of humanity, our posts now fall into the new political category. Your shares, likes, and comments really now mean more than ever as they help overcome the extra barriers our posts face. Thanks for your help.

Sp S on S so S red S  \u00b7  On August 12th, fascists and white-supremacists will rally at Lafayette Park for the anniversary of the Unite The Right Rally. Join us at 12 pm  at Freedom Plaza , to show the white-supremacists that they are outnumbered.  At the Unite the Right rally last year, these Nazi thugs occupied and overwhelmed the city of Charlottesville, Virginia. The white-supremacists killed Heather Heyer that day. She was a brave IWW militant and she will forever be remembered as a martyr to the  ... cause. They also seriously injured others, including the ISO\u2019s own Bill Burke.  Now, on the one year anniversary of the tragedy in Charlottesville, the white-supremacists are rallying in front of the White House because even though their movement shows signs of fracture, the White House is occupied by one of their own.   We believe the best way to confront fascists is directly challenge them with large numbers of people.  This means having mass marches and recent history shows that the most successful efforts in defeating the fascists have been based on nonviolent, mass action. Last year right after Charlottesville, white-supremacists gathered in Boston, thinking they had the momentum. However, thousands turned up to confront a tiny group, and the fascists cancelled their event after 30 minutes, escorted by police and humiliated. Let us do the same thing in Washington D.C.   We need to bring out as many people as possible from as many different backgrounds - Black Lives Matter activists, immigrants rights activists, women's rights activists, activists against war and imperialism - all have an interest in stopping the far right and all of them are necessary to chase them back into the holes they came out of.  Only in numbers will we be safe and win. Only in numbers, will violence and provocation will be unnecessary. Only in numbers, will we demoralize and beat the fascists, build up our own confidence and movements.   Join us in the fight against white-supremacy, meet near Freedom Plaza, bring as many people as you can. This is our city. We will win.   Solidarity trumps hate!

{"id":"6103255577389","text":"NC Senator Floyd B. McKissick Jr. Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  McKissick for NC Senate  \u00b7  A Special Saturday Session of the North Carolina General Assembly to Override Governor Cooper\u2019s Vetoes  Today, there was another Special Session of the North Carolina General Assembly which was called with the sole purpose of overriding Governor Cooper\u2019s veto of bills that were hastily passed approximately two weeks ago. One of the bills, House Bill 3, essentially removed the powers given to a special commission composed of Secretary of State Elaine Marshall, Attorney General  ... Josh Stein, and Legislative Services Director Paul Coble, to create brief descriptions or captions for each of the six constitutional amendments which will be on the ballot in the November General Election. The language relating to these amendments is already vague, ambiguous, and deceptive, and the captions that would\u2019ve been provided by this commission would\u2019ve eliminated some of that ambiguity. This is precisely why these powers were removed from the commission since the commission is composed of two Democrats and one Republican.  The other bill, Senate Bill 3, is targeted specifically at those running for judgeships in our state and it will remove a person\u2019s party affiliation from the ballot if the person changed parties within 90 days of filing to run for office. While this bill is specifically designed and targeted to limit the number of Republicans running for a seat on the NC Supreme Court from two to one, it also will impact approximately 4 other persons running for judgeships across our state. All of this was done after judicial primaries were eliminated, and after the filing period for those running for judgeships had passed and it was known which candidates would be on the ballot, and after all judicial races were made partisan races. This is like changing the rules of a basketball game in the 4th quarter. These two bills are just another attempt for the Republicans to grab more power and to rig elections in a way that mislead the voters of our state. This is not what we need in NC. We can and must do better. Please hold these legislators accountable in November.

There's a real cloud of pessimism out there -- a lot of talk about people leaving the state and how the moving vans are lined up around the corner.

{"id":"6110179032740","text":"Jan Schneider Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  Friends of Jan Schneider  \u00b7  RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS  On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.  President Johnson recognized that \u201c[t]he vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice.\u201d   For nearly 50 years, Section 5 of the VRA required jurisdictions with the worst records to obtain preclearance from the federal government before implementing voting changes. In June 2013, however, the United States Supreme Court essentially gut ... ted Section 5 in the 5-to-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder.  The Court ruled that Section 4(b), which contains the coverage formula for Section 5, is unconstitutional because it is based on data that is over 40 years old and no longer responsive to current needs.  Without Section 4(b), no jurisdiction will be subject to preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula. Almost immediately following the Shelby decision, states and localities released from federal oversight began imposing new obstacles to voting, shortening early voting periods and closing polling places.  As recently as June 2018, the Supreme Court struck another blow to voting rights in ruling 5-to-4 in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute that the practice by the State of Ohio in purging infrequent voters from registration rolls is constitutional. This decision too is likely to lead to disproportionate disenfranchisement of minority, low-income, elderly and disabled voters.   Help restore justice and the right to vote: 1.  Contact your senators to urge them to oppose confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court; 2.  Contact your senators and representatives in support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2017 (S.1419 & H.R.2978); and 3, in Florida vote for Amendment 4.  Also, join the fight to overturn the Citizens United case!

{"id":"6097967908804","text":"Buffy Wicks Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  Buffy Wicks for Assembly 2018. FPPC #1396734  \u00b7  Nine years ago today, the United States Senate voted to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor as the first Latina to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. And on this day 53-years ago, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law - which expanded the promise of universal suffrage by dismantling some of the systems that kept minority voters from casting a ballot. That both should fall on the same date is fitting, as Justice Sotomayor has been an avid defender of the VRA on the ...  Supreme Court - forcefully dissenting from recent decisions that have seen the slow and steady erosion of the promises made and protections put in place by the VRA.   One of the fondest memories I have of my time working for President  Barack Obama , came just after Justice Sotomayor returned to the White House having just been confirmed by the Senate. I was part of the team that worked on her confirmation - I had been tasked with helping to mobilize support for her confirmation from outside advocacy organizations. And after the successful vote to confirm her to the Court, we held a little celebration in the White House. I vividly remember Justice Sotomayor thanking me and giving me a big hug. It was such a joyful, warm and genuine moment.  Justice Sotomayor\u2019s work on the Court has made us all very proud - as the President knew it would. And she has been a forceful defender of voting rights and the Voting Rights Act.   Her steadfast defense of voting rights was prominently on display this past June, in Abbott vs. Perez - where the Court decided to uphold Texas\u2019 gerrymandered districts. This was despite the fact that a lower court had previously found that the districts had been intentionally drawn to discriminate against Latinx voters. The words of her dissenting opinion are a clarion call to action in defense of voting rights:    \u201cThe Court today goes out of its way to permit the State of Texas to use maps that the three-judge District Court unanimously found were adopted for the purpose of preserving the racial discrimination that tainted its previous maps\u2026 This disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy. It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas\u2014despite constituting a majority of the population within the State\u2014will continue to be underrepresented in the political process. Those voters must return to the polls in 2018 and 2020 with the knowledge that their ability to exercise meaningfully their right to vote has been burdened by the manipulation of district lines specifically designed to target their communities and minimize their political will. The fundamental right to vote is too precious to be disregarded in this manner.

{"id":"6114199808601","text":"Penzeys Spices Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  Penzeys  \u00b7  Free Kind Pin\u2014$2 Aleppo/Mitchell Street at   Penzeys your 2018 Kindness Campaign HQ!  For years our pro-kindness message was not seen as political at all. It was only with the advent of unlimited political spending that us doing what we\u2019ve always done became political. Money buys anger, and as the Republican Party embraced anger, racism, greed and all the rest, it found a target in our belief in kindness.   I truly believe that we never crossed the line into politics, that line  ... crossed us. I\u2019m not saying we haven\u2019t embraced this new role. We are a business by Cooks for Cooks. Cooking works because it gives us the strength to care about others, the strength to be human. Now does not seem the time to back down from all this. So, \u201c2018 Kindness Campaign Victory Headquarters\u201d for us.  What does being the Kindness Campaign Headquarters mean? Well, we are kind of finding our way on this, but already I have much hope for where we will end up. At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when we take the time to care about others a better future is set in motion. In our experience we\u2019ve found that what works around the dinner table works around the world as well. When you care about humans they go on to do amazing things.  The plan is to start slow and learn along the way. Mostly for the next couple weeks that start will be right here in our home state of Wisconsin where the primary election will be held August 14. Our hope is to take what we learn here in the primaries and roll that out in our stores across the country in a get out the vote effort come this October leading into the November 6 national election. And of course 2018 is just the lead-in to 2020 and beyond. We hope to be at this for a long time.

For more on Mitchell Street click here:  https://www.penzeys.com/\u2026/mitchell-street-s\u2026/c-24/p-652/pd-s  With Aleppo Pepper the story is more complex. Where this really tasty Pepper originally comes from is a town in Syria. For a long time, because of the war there, our Aleppo Pepper has come from just across the border in Turkey. Many of those who voted for an unqualified, Russia compromised, openly racist President have so far been spared the costs of their actions. The people of Syria have not been so lucky.  Many in Syria have not been able to dodge the reality of our election, and have paid an incredible cost for Americans rejecting a well qualified woman who understood diplomacy and how to rally allies to our side in favor of a candidate that has simply given the people of Syria up to the wishes of the Russian President. When this administration inevitably crashes, simply saying we\u2019re sorry to the people of Syria won\u2019t be enough. We have a lot of work ahead of us to pay for our responsibilities.   Aleppo Pepper is truly wonderful: a little bit of heat and a whole lot of really enjoyable flavor. See our Aleppo here:  https://www.penzeys.com/online-c\u2026/aleppo-pepper/\u2026/p-878/pd-s  Get some, use it in your cooking, share its tastiness, but please make it a reminder that voting for change this November 6 is only the first step. We are Americans; we take responsibility for our actions. We must work both at home and across the globe to make this right. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s what we do.

Sp S on S so S red S  \u00b7  On August 12th, fascists and white-supremacists will rally at Lafayette Park for the anniversary of the Unite The Right Rally. Join us at 12 pm  at Freedom Plaza , to show the white-supremacists that they are outnumbered.  At the Unite the Right rally last year, these Nazi thugs occupied and overwhelmed the city of Charlottesville, Virginia. The white-supremacists killed Heather Heyer that day. She was a brave IWW militant and she will forever be remembered as a martyr to the  ... cause. They also seriously injured others, including the ISO\u2019s own Bill Burke.  Now, on the one year anniversary of the tragedy in Charlottesville, the white-supremacists are rallying in front of the White House because even though their movement shows signs of fracture, the White House is occupied by one of their own.   We believe the best way to confront fascists is directly challenge them with large numbers of people.  This means having mass marches and recent history shows that the most successful efforts in defeating the fascists have been based on nonviolent, mass action. Last year right after Charlottesville, white-supremacists gathered in Boston, thinking they had the momentum. However, thousands turned up to confront a tiny group, and the fascists cancelled their event after 30 minutes, escorted by police and humiliated. Let us do the same thing in Washington D.C.   We need to bring out as many people as possible from as many different backgrounds - Black Lives Matter activists, immigrants rights activists, women's rights activists, activists against war and imperialism - all have an interest in stopping the far right and all of them are necessary to chase them back into the holes they came out of.  Only in numbers will we be safe and win. Only in numbers, will violence and provocation will be unnecessary. Only in numbers, will we demoralize and beat the fascists, build up our own confidence and movements.   Join us in the fight against white-supremacy, meet near Freedom Plaza, bring as many people as you can. This is our city. We will win.   Solidarity trumps hate!

McKissick Jr. Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  McKissick for NC Senate  \u00b7  A Special Saturday Session of the North Carolina General Assembly to Override Governor Cooper\u2019s Vetoes  Today, there was another Special Session of the North Carolina General Assembly which was called with the sole purpose of overriding Governor Cooper\u2019s veto of bills that were hastily passed approximately two weeks ago. One of the bills, House Bill 3, essentially removed the powers given to a special commission composed of Secretary of State Elaine Marshall, Attorney General  ... Josh Stein, and Legislative Services Director Paul Coble, to create brief descriptions or captions for each of the six constitutional amendments which will be on the ballot in the November General Election. The language relating to these amendments is already vague, ambiguous, and deceptive, and the captions that would\u2019ve been provided by this commission would\u2019ve eliminated some of that ambiguity. This is precisely why these powers were removed from the commission since the commission is composed of two Democrats and one Republican.  The other bill, Senate Bill 3, is targeted specifically at those running for judgeships in our state and it will remove a person\u2019s party affiliation from the ballot if the person changed parties within 90 days of filing to run for office. While this bill is specifically designed and targeted to limit the number of Republicans running for a seat on the NC Supreme Court from two to one, it also will impact approximately 4 other persons running for judgeships across our state. All of this was done after judicial primaries were eliminated, and after the filing period for those running for judgeships had passed and it was known which candidates would be on the ballot, and after all judicial races were made partisan races. This is like changing the rules of a basketball game in the 4th quarter. These two bills are just another attempt for the Republicans to grab more power and to rig elections in a way that mislead the voters of our state. This is not what we need in NC. We can and must do better. Please hold these legislators accountable in November.

{"id":"6110179032740","text":"Jan Schneider Sponsored  \u22c5 Paid for by  Friends of Jan Schneider  \u00b7  RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS  On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.  President Johnson recognized that \u201c[t]he vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice.\u201d   For nearly 50 years, Section 5 of the VRA required jurisdictions with the worst records to obtain preclearance from the federal government before implementing voting changes. In June 2013, however, the United States Supreme Court essentially gut ... ted Section 5 in the 5-to-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder.  The Court ruled that Section 4(b), which contains the coverage formula for Section 5, is unconstitutional because it is based on data that is over 40 years old and no longer responsive to current needs.  Without Section 4(b), no jurisdiction will be subject to preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula. Almost immediately following the Shelby decision, states and localities released from federal oversight began imposing new obstacles to voting, shortening early voting periods and closing polling places.  As recently as June 2018, the Supreme Court struck another blow to voting rights in ruling 5-to-4 in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute that the practice by the State of Ohio in purging infrequent voters from registration rolls is constitutional. This decision too is likely to lead to disproportionate disenfranchisement of minority, low-income, elderly and disabled voters.   Help restore justice and the right to vote: 1.  Contact your senators to urge them to oppose confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court; 2.  Contact your senators and representatives in support of the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2017 (S.1419 & H.R.2978); and 3, in Florida vote for Amendment 4.
